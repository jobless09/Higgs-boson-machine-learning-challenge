# Higgs-boson-machine-learning-challenge
The Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge (HiggsML or the Challenge for short) was organized to promote collaboration between high energy physicists and data scientists. The ATLAS experiment at CERN provided simulated data that has been used by physicists in a search for the Higgs boson.
